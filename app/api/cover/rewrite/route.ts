- Ensure the entire output is visually aligned and consistently indented
- Each bullet point must start with "• " (bullet character + one space) if using bullets
- Wrapped lines must align exactly under the first letter of the sentence, not under the bullet
- Keep line spacing balanced and readable

- Output only the formatted content directly, without any preface or explanation
- Maintain professional tone while focusing on clean alignment and formatting`
